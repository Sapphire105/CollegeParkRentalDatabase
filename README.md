# College Park Rental Database

Every year, thousands of students, both domestic and international, move to College Park to pursue an education at University of Maryland. And obviously, a top convern for them is accommodation. We thought this made for an interesting application of the principles we learned from our Database Management Systems course from the MS in Business Analytics program at UMD.

For a small business called Terps Abode Realtors which assists UMD students in finding suitable housing in and around campus based on their requirements, my team and I created a database on MS SQL server from scratch including -
* Database Design and ER Diagram
* Definition of ER Schema (Functional Dependencies, Normalizations, Business Rules, Referential Integrities)
* Data Collection
* Data Definition Language
* Sample queries
* Visualizations on Tableau by connecting database to the application

The project was definitely a great means to understanding the nuances of EFFECTIVE database design which can have a lasting impact on the work of everyone working with data in an organization.
